       following zero sequence connections that are shown in Figure 5-18.
        1 series path, no ground path.
        2 no series path, ground path on Winding 1 side.
        3 no series path, ground path on Winding 2 side.
        4 no series or ground paths.
        5 series path, ground path on Winding 2 side (normally only used 
          as part of a three-winding transformer).
        6 no series path, ground path on Winding 1 side, earthing transformer 
          on Winding 2 side.
         7 no series path, earthing transformer on Winding 1 side, ground path 
          on Winding 2 side.
         8 series path, ground path on each side.
         9 series path on each side, ground path at the junction point of the two 
           series path
