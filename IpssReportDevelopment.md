## Introduction ##

InterPSS reports are based on an open-source report development system, [JasperReports](http://www.jasperforge.org/). The reports are template based. All report templates are located at the 

&lt;install&gt;

/reportTemplate directory. One can modify the templates, plugin modified templates into InterPSS and create custom reports, for example, reports in Chinese language.

The currently InterPSS reports are quite rudimentary. They are only for preview purpose. The InterPSS development team is looking for user's feedback and user's participation to further develop the reports. The goal of this sub-project is to provide a common place for user participation and contribution.
