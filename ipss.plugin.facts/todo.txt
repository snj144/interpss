// LFSolverWithStatcom
1. Update network with STATCOM injection
2. Solve the traditional load flow
3. Update states of STATCOMs by recalculate vsh, considering of control type

Problems:
1. Errors when testing SVC constant V control on bus 7 of the ieee14 system: the voltage after re-calculate the load flow is not in consist with the
voltage before the load flow, it seems to be the initial value other than the converged value.
